The taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which Hernán Cortés arranged for his captains in Coyoacán.

Etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word "tlahco", meaning "half" or "in the middle,"[9] in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.[10] Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the Nahuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn tortilla).

According to Jeffrey M. Pilcher, professor of history at the University of Minnesota, tacos started to become a mainstream food between 1910 and 1920 when children of immigrants from Mexico (who came to work the mines and railroads) started to advance economically.
