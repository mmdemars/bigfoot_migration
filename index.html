			<h3 id="about-bigfoot">About Bigfoot</h3>
			<p>Sightings of Bigfoot or Sasquatch have been reported in the US dating back to 1811, when British
				explorer
				David Thompson reporting finding footprints. Sasquatch is variably described as a primate ranging
				from 6
				to 15 feet (2 to 4.5 metres) tall, standing erect on two feet, often giving off a foul smell, and
				either
				moving silently or emitting a high-pitched cry. Footprints have measured up to 24 inches (60 cm) in
				length and 8 inches (20 cm) in width. A Soviet scientist, Boris Porshnev, suggested that Sasquatch
				and
				his Siberian counterpart, the Almas, could be a remnant of Neanderthals, but most scientists do not
				recognize the creature’s existence.</p>
			<img src="static/Patterson–Gimlin_film_frame_352.jpeg" class="left" alt="This is frame 352 from the Patterson-Gimlin film taken on October 20, 1967, claiming to depict Bigfoot/Sasquatch.
""				/><p>Sasquatch is the anglicization of the name Sasq'ets, from the Halq’emeylem language spoken by First
				Nations peoples in southwestern British Columbia, roughly translating to " hairy man". Members of the Lummi tell
				tales about creatures known as Ts'emekwes. The stories are similar to each other in the general
				descriptions of Ts'emekwes, but details differed among various family accounts concerning the creature's
				diet and activities. Some regional versions tell of more threatening creatures: the stiyaha or
				kwi-kwiyai were a nocturnal race, and children were warned against saying the names so that
				the "monsters" would not come and carry them off to be killed. The Iroquois tell of an aggressive, hair
				covered giant with rock-hard skin known as the Ot ne yar heh or "Stone Giant" , more commonly referred
				to as the Genoskwa. In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the natives about skoocooms, a race of
				cannibalistic wild men living on the peak of Mount St. Helens in southern Washington.</p>
			<p><strong>Origin of the "Bigfoot" name</strong></p>
			<p>In 1958, Jerry Crew, a logging company bulldozer operator in Humboldt County, California, discovered
				a
				set of large, 410 millimetres (16 in) human-like footprints sunk deep within the mud in the Six
				Rivers
				National Forest. Upon informing his coworkers, many claimed to have seen similar tracks on previous
				job
				sites as well as telling of odd incidents such as an oil drum weighing 450 pounds (200 kg) having
				been
				moved without explanation. The logging company men soon began utilizing the term "Bigfoot" to
				describe
				the mysterious culprit. Crew, who initially believed someone was playing a prank on them, once again
				observed more of these numerous, massive footprints and contacted reporter Andrew Genzoli of the
				Humboldt Times newspaper. Genzoli interviewed lumber workers and wrote articles about the mysterious
				footprints, introducing the name "Bigfoot" in relation to the tracks and the local tales of large,
				hairy
				wild men. A plaster cast was made of the footprints and Crew appeared, holding one of the casts, on
				the
				front page of the newspaper on October 6, 1958. The story spread rapidly as Genzoli began to receive
				correspondence from major media outlets including the New York and Los Angeles Times. As a result,
				the
				term "Bigfoot" became widespread as a reference to an apparently large, unknown creature leaving
				massive
				footprints in Northern California.</p>

			<h3 id="about-tacos">About Tacos</h3>

			<p>The taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico. There is anthropological evidence that the
				indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos filled
				with
				small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal Díaz del Castillo documented
				the
				first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which Hernán Cortés arranged for his captains in
				Coyoacán.
			</p>
			<p>Etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally theoretical. One possibility is that the
				word derives from the Nahuatl word "tlahco", meaning "half" or "in the middle," in the sense that
				food
				would be placed in the middle of a tortilla. Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to
				have existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the Nahuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn
				tortilla).</p>
			<p>According to Jeffrey M. Pilcher, professor of history at the University of Minnesota, tacos started
				to
				become a mainstream food between 1910 and 1920 when children of immigrants from Mexico (who came to
				work
				the mines and railroads) started to advance economically.</p>

			<h3 id="preparing-the-images">Why Bigfoot and Tacos?</h3>

			<p>Nothing complicated - I like the idea of bigfoot, and who doesn't love tacos?</p>
			<p>Also, who wouldn't want to know the best local spot to get tacos while on your bigfoot hunting
				expedition? They're like the most perfect portable food. Food wrapped in food. Though not good to
				eat
				while driving, second worst food to eat while driving right after spaghetti. I will not be taking
				questions about that.</p>


			<p><small><i>Monsters, monsters don't love tacos. Bigfoot is not a monster.</i></small></p>

			<h3 id="project-plan">Project plan...</h3>
			<p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p>
			<p>A data set was obtained from <a href="https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data"
					target="_blank">data.world</a> - a datatset that Timothy Renner obtained by datascrapping the
				BRFO
				website ranging from 1925 to 2004; broken down into three classifications of "quality" of sighting.
			</p>
			<p> A secondary dataset was pulled from kaggle which was supposed to contain a list of 19,439
				restaurants and similar businesses with menu items containing "burrito" or "taco" in their names.
				Data
				was to be cleaned and analyzed for geographical similarities in locations - between the datasets and
				within the bigfoot sightings.</p>
			<p>Machine learning would be used to find patterns in the bigfoot sightings, and all locations would be
				mapped. Questions to be answered included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Can bigfoot sightings be predicted based on historical data?
				</li>
				<li>Are there similarities in bigfoot sighting hotspots and taco locations?
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Issues that arose through data exploration:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Bigfoot sighting data comes from self-reporting from not-biologists.

				</li>
				<li>Many sightings were reported long after the "sighting" occured - sometimes years.
				</li>
				<li>Most of the "taco" data was anything but tacos.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Phase 2</strong></p>
			<p>Merge the datasets and run more machine learning and <i><b>see what happens.</b></i></p>

			<h3 id="preparing-the-images">Results...</h3>
			<p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p>

			<p>There are reported bigfoot sightings in every state in the US aside from Hawaii. Non-chain taco
				establishments can probably be found in every state in the US, though my list did not have any that
				made
				the cut in Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, or Vermont. The inital maching learning algorithm
				could
				not make predicitions on bigfoot sighting locations more accurate than 52%(slightly better than a
				coin
				flip), and refining the data to only include the "Class A" sightings, listed on the brfo website as:
			</p>
			<blockquote>"Class A reports involve clear sightings in circumstances where misinterpretation or
				misidentification of other animals can be ruled out with greater confidence. For example, there are
				several footprint cases that are very well documented. These are considered Class A reports, because
				misidentification of common animals can be confidently ruled out, thus the potential for
				misinterpretation is very low."</blockquote>
			<p>dropped accuracy to 11%.
			</p>
			<p>Attempts to visually identify possible migration patterns by color coding the sighting data based on
				season were all unimpressive, resulting in a colorful mismosh with no pattern discernable to the
				human
				eye.</p>
